# What is it?
## Scenario
Have you ever looked at an upcoming exam date and thought, "Hmm. How am I going to study for THIS exam." You would go through the usual motions of looking over lecture slides, notes, and assignments.
But then how would you test your knowledge? You would carefully look through all the course resources to rarely find supplementary practice materials or inevitably run out. What to do?
- Manufacture some questions (objectively not a great idea 😅).
- Maybe use lecture slides posed examples (kinda lost the element of surprise 🤨).
- Continue searching for practice resources online (won't accurately reflect exam 😑).

EduVaultAI attempts address this gap in opportunities to practice what you learned quickly and efficiently.

So to answer the question, *"What is EduVaultAI?"*

✨ **It is a place where in addition to storing and managing your course materials you can create specially curated practice exams, study guides, etc.** ✨

# Who is it for?
For our folks in college... well anybody who is a full-time learner and appreciates a productive study.

# What does it do?
## Features
- **Intuitive Dashboard**
  - Navigate a home hub of your files at a glance.
- **File Management System**
  - Organize and manage your "vault"[^1] of uploaded/created materials.
- **Practice Material Creation**
  - Create practice materials through a intuitive process of iteration and refinement with your feedback if the results weren't what you were looking for.
  - Types of materials: Practice Exams and Study Guides (open to future ideas).

[^1]: The primary resource used by our LLM.

## Benefits to you
- More opportunities to practice your knowledge for an upcoming exam (or just cause 🤓).
- Less time spent searching for supplementary practice materials.
- Staying organized with your study materials for the entire semester.

## What's unique
It's a pleasant (little subjective but we're students with high expectations for this kind of stuff) and intuitive UI to power a practice material creation workflow.
Creating and managing course study material can all be done in one place.
