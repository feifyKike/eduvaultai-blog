# What is it?
## Scenario
Have you ever looked at an upcoming exam date and thought, "Hmm. How am I going to study for THIS exam." You would go through the usual motions of looking over lecture slides, notes, and assignments.
But then how would you test your knowledge? You would carefully look through all the course resources to rarely find supplementary practice materials or inevitably run out. What to do?
- Manufacture some questions? Objectively not a great idea 😅.
- Maybe use lecture slides posed examples? Kinda lost the element of surprise 🤨.
- Continue searching for practice resources online? Won't accurately reflect exam 😑.

EduVaultAI attempts address this gap in opportunities to practice what you learned quickly and efficiently.

So to answer the question, *"What is EduVaultAI?"*

✨ **A place to store, organize, and use your course materials to create specially curated study resources such as practice exams, study guides, and more.** ✨

# Who is it for?
For our folks in college... well anybody who is a full-time learner and appreciates a productive study.
